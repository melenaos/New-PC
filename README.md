# New-PC
Installation sequence when I buy a new PC

## Office
To find the installation media for Office 2019/2016 visit https://account.microsoft.com/services

Visit [setup.office.com](https://setup.office.com/) to activate a new license.

## PowerShell
Install the [New powershell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0&WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) from the marketplace.

Change the default shell to the 'PowerShell' and maybe edit the settings.json to clear up some unneeded shells

Download [CascadiaCode font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/CascadiaCode.zip?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha), unzip and install them.

Change the Terminal settings to use `CascadiaCode NF` font.
